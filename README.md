# Student-Database-Management-System
The Student database management system is CPP based application specifically designed to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve information related to students in an educational institution. It serves as a centralized repository for organizing and maintaining various details about students, providing a systematic and structured approach to handling student data.
## Key Features:
### 1.Student Information Storage:
The system effectively stores crucial student details such as names, roll numbers, parents' names, age, and courses.
### 2.User-Friendly Interface:
I've designed a straightforward command-line interface for adding students, displaying information, deleting students, and searching for students. It's simple and easy to use.
### 3.Data Retrieval:
Users can retrieve specific student information by searching for either the student's roll number or name. This makes it convenient to look up individual students quickly.
### 4.Data Modification and Update:
The system allows users to add new student records, update existing information, and delete student records based on their roll numbers. It covers the essential CRUD operations for managing student data.
### 5.Security and Access Control:
While access control is not explicitly implemented in this version, there's potential for future enhancements to include different user roles with varying levels of access for security reasons.


<sub>I believe this Student Database Management System can serve as a practical solution for managing student information in educational settings.</sub>
